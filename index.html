<h3>Hunt Lagoon</h3>

<h3>Known primarily for it's hidden location on Kamar Island (which includes swimming through an underground cave), Hunt Lagoon offers
a peaceful respite from the tourist-laden locations found throughout Kamar. If possible, make a visit at night â€“ it's bioluminescent lagoon
is like viewing fireworks in the water!</h3>

<h3> Moat Lagoon </h3>

<h3>Last, but certainly not least, is Moat Lagoon. This is one of the most difficult beach locations to access. The lagoon is located inside of a
prehistoric cenote, or underground aquifer. Accessing it involves crossing the moat surrounding the lagoon (hence the name) with locals by kayak.
Once there, marvel at the phenomenal (and endangered) quetzal bird and its golden feathers.</h3>
